I am starting my blog to share my daily thoughts and updates.

Right now, I am at my end of my last semester as graduate student at Kyung Hee University International College, Suwon, South Korea. I am working on my master's thesis on "Multi-modal large language model for Quantum State and Circuit Estimation". 

My research is currently is being accepted by my professor and I working to finish this paper before the start of new semester in March. That mean I need to finish this in February. The current content of the paper actually is very good but it still need more proof reading and the content itself need more source of material.
