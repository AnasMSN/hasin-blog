Commitment is one thing I almost always fail in Korea. No matter the case, it always the same struggle to find myself excited to do something that I already bored or I already scheduled to always do when  I started the plan.

Many things that make me fail to commit. There is sometimes because my body became weak and it break my rhythm to do anything consistently. There  also issue of outer environment that make me less likely to commit to something. Then the issue of my mental or confidence that sometimes low, it makes me loss the goal why I need  to do that. 

This blog is one thing that I try to become more consistent. I already write  7 pages and I think that already a good thing that I can still write even though it not much.
