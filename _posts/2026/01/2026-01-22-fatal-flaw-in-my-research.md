Today, I am starting to prepare for long day of lab work. I bring my tab and phone charget to stay long in the lab. This imake me feel easier and comfortable at lab. I can play games even though I'm not at home. Other thing i bring is my packed dinner so I don't  really mind to feel hungry at lab. 

I hope I can finish my work like my paper acronym issues, my paper simulation that usually needs time, and other organization works. I hope I can feel to be more productive and make some schedule here too. Lets read this again tomorrow and see what happen. :)
