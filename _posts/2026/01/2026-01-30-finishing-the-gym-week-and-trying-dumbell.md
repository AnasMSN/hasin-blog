Today is the day I finish the week of my Gym week. I actually impress with myself since I finsh it and basically do it everyday. I will give the weekend as my rest week since of course you need one or two day rest. But, the gym week is just very easy because I set the  standard very low. I'm believe progress need time and you cannot just place it all in one day. So the first week I mainly just do running and stretching using the apps.

Today I also trying  the dumbell. I start with the lightest dumbell that is 3 KG. I learn some moves on using dumbell from my friend Phone. First one is tricep where you sit straight and you pull the dumbell behind  you. The second one is in 45 degree seat where you go face-down and you also pull two dumbell with both your hands. The third one you must  make the seat in 180 degree and then in each side you place your hand and leg on your left to the bench and using your right hand you pull the bell again. Do the same way for your other side. The last one you lying face up and you push the dumbell with both of your hands. I do all the reps in 12 times and then in the middle of each reps I rest for around 1 minute. Thats all for today interesting event that happens.
