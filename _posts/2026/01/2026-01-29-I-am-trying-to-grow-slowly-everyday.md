Today, I got interesting information about myself. I watch Escape episode in the morning and I learn something. I feel like its better to grow slowly everyday than to grow fast and then fall massively. I actually learn to stop my ego since when I think I can added more weight to my body, I thinking that I'm doing for the future not now. 

I'm also learn to somewhat "losing". What I mean by losing here is just take L on something I cannot do at that time. Its better that I can do it later. But, in this losing thing, make sure you can win it later by doing the activities you want to do later.
