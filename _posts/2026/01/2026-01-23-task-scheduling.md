Today, I feel like my schedule in the lab is not good. I try to improve my task and time management by learning how to schdule my time from youtube. I learn that currently I overmanage my time and didn't give room to breath in blocking some time for some task. I implement the changes using my google calendar and currently I just make the calendar very simple on 4 particular task and make it more flexible in the time what should I do at that time.

One thing that is blocking everyday is the time management evaluation that I put in the last one hour before sleep. I will evaluate what will I do tomorrow and reschduling and improve the method what should I improve in scheduling my time for tomorrow.
