Gym life is always in my mind and I always want to try it to keep my body fit. I starting that dream today since I have enough money to buy the gym membership. I will try to go to gym every time I like it. In winter, I think I will go more often since its colder inside my Home than the gym. 

Today, I start slowly by just doing some stretching and running in treadmill. I use my subscription on app to help me do stretching.
