NPD is the acroynym of Narcissistic Personality Disorder. It is a mental health condition that think his own self is the most (si paling) on anything. One of the thing that can be used in this kind of information is when to find and know more about somebody.

Thing to ask is like:
1. How do you manage your anger?
2. How  your relation with your parent and  what is your parents like?
3. How do you manage your money and how do you use it?


That's the three which in my mind on how to know is somebody is narcissistic or not. But, it doesn't mean that people with narcissistic is bad. Narcissistic is good so you build confidence on yourself. Me for example, I think I'm narcissistic but I place it in wrong place. I feel like  I have very sad backstory even though when I think about it its not really that sad. I still not confident enough on myself even though I narcissistic in some cases. I need to improve this narcissistic into confidence on myself and move narcissistic into something positive and build myself to the better.
