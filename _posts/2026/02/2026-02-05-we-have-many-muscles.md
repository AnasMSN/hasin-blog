We as human had many muscles in our body. I just finish my second day following chatgpt instructions for my workout plan. Because today is the day of my lower body  I thought it will be easy since every day we walk and definitely our lower body strong. That's not the case at all. I just knew that in lower body we have so many muscles we can train and I just knew that I don't even use that muscle like my calf. I only use my tiptoe to stand up (jinjit). Then even when I use like pull up machine, you don't really need to always do pull up. You can just do the knee up with only using your hand as the base for your knee up.

Do the workout based on chatgpt actually not hard at all. It definitely make more sweaty when I do running in treadmill rather than do the workout. But, I feel my head burning that the one I doing in one reps at a time using the workout routine. It seems that for one specific case, it hard at one time. But after I done it feels not as hard as running for 30 minutes. 

Yesterday I done my weekly meeting with Brian. I feel too sleepy. Maybe it because my body not adapt yet with my weekly workout. The meeting give me more list things to do as it makes the thing I do before not really impacting any of the writing I done in my paper. I will do the things Brian assign me to do one by one. Hopefully I can successfully finish all the task in this week. And I almost forgot that there will be kickoff meeting on Friday to do side project that mainly about android apps. Hopefully I can learn and try to push myself to make this side project successfull.
