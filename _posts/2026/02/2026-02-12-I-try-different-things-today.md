Today, I didn't start my days with gym. But I start my day with just steady wake up and take a shower. I plan to move my gym time at night so it will complement to my day in Ramadhan. Hopefully this will be successful. Since in Ramadhan I can't eat in the days, I will focusing more at night and will try to complement my night also with Quran and Taraweh. Maybe I will start taraweh just for 4 rakaat first and gym at night.
