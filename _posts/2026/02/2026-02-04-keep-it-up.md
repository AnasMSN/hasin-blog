Today main thing is only consistency. I keep up the consistency like before. I done all the things that chatgpt suggested for my workout routine. It feels easier compare to my usual routine. That's maybe because I using the lightest weight and not really push myself to the limit. I mean you must do slowly so the consistency still become part of you in making gym part of your life. 

I feel like something that removed from myself that need to be improved is reading. I place book in front of my face in my working desk but I'm not read that book at all. I also place one inside my home and I think its already 4 days I'm not touching that book. It feel like it because I also don't read my Quran for a while. I will do it starting now to implement myself to become better person and fill my waste of time to something better.
