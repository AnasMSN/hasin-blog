Yesterday I learn about how to marinate chicken properly. I actually start to experiment myself what to make chicken more flavorfull and the chicken to be soaked with juicy and good mixture. I now know about brine that soak the chicken with salted water for some time. Then I also learn about how to make the chicken blood gone from the chicken is by soaked the chicken first in water for some time. After that you also clean the chicken again with water. Then you can implement the marination you want after that.

Today, I air fry the chicken and it taste very good and flavorful. Maybe it also because I'm very hungry thats why it taste even better. Its also very juicy since i also mixed the chicken with milk. It feel like the milk seep into the chick and make it very juicy. I left it for one whole day in freezer and since  I just using plastic, I don't really need to clean anything after.

Today, I keep my gym routine consistent. I do running, but since I konw running keep your body warmer, I use that to then use for many of all body exercises. Today I will generate my own workouut plan for 8 month. But first, I will generate for my first week, where I still have 3 more  days to be utilized. These are my schedule for the first week. First of all this is the prompt:

"I'm subscribe to gym membership for 8 months. But first, I need to generate for my first week, where I still have 3 more days to be utilized. My first two days I'm just focusing in treadmill and just small exercise usin gym equipment and dumbell. I ithink my gym have all the gym equipment. Based on that data, please make the workout plan for my first three days. Then after I will ask the follow up week"

and 

"Okay, maybe I think you need more context, so my goal is to make my body posture better and remove bad fat in my body, especially in my belly. I give you my in body test too. Do you think theres an adjustment from your plan suggestion?"

Then, this is the result:

## 1️⃣ What your InBody actually says (important points)

**Your stats (key ones):**

* Height: 172 cm
* Weight: 77.3 kg
* Body fat %: **29.8%** (high for male)
* Skeletal muscle mass: **30.6 kg** (okay / average)
* Visceral fat level: **8** (not dangerous, but needs reduction)
* Waist–hip ratio: **0.89** (borderline)

**Interpretation (plain language):**

* You **don’t lack muscle**
* Your main issue is **fat storage around the belly**
* Posture issues usually come from:

  * weak core
  * weak glutes
  * tight hips & chest
  * too much sitting

👉 So the goal is:

* **fat loss without losing muscle**
* **core + glutes + upper-back focus**
* **no aggressive bulking**

---

## 2️⃣ What needs to change from the original plan

### ❌ What we reduce

* Too much random arm isolation
* Long slow treadmill only
* Heavy chest focus early on

### ✅ What we increase

* Core work **every session**
* Glutes & posterior chain
* Upper-back (posture muscles)
* Incline walking / light intervals

## 3️⃣ Adjusted First-Week Plan (3 Days)

This is **still beginner-safe**, but now aligned with your goal.

---

# **Day 1 – Posture + Core Focus**

(Upper back, shoulders, abs)

### Warm-up

* Treadmill **incline walk**
  10 min (speed 5–6, incline 5–8%)

---

# **Day 2 – Lower Body + Belly Fat Helper**

(Glutes + legs = better posture + fat burn)

### Warm-up

# **Day 3 – Fat-Loss Full Body**

(This day helps belly fat most)

### Warm-up

* 5 min walk (4.5 – 5.5 km/h, 0 – 2% incline, warm heart rate)

### Workout (Circuit style)

Repeat **3 rounds**, rest 1–2 min between rounds:

1. **Leg Press** – 12 reps
2. **Chest Press Machine** – 10 reps
3. **Lat Pulldown** – 10 reps
4. **Dumbbell Romanian Deadlift** – 12 reps
5. **Cable Woodchopper** – 10 each side

### Finisher

* Treadmill:
  1 min fast walk → 1 min slow
  × 6 rounds (12 min)

---

## 4️⃣ Extra rules that matter more than exercise

### Belly fat removal depends on:

* **Protein intake** (very important)
* Slight calorie deficit
* Sleep
* Consistency

### Simple target (no stress):

* Protein: **1.6–1.8 g/kg** body weight
  → around **120–135 g/day**
* Steps: **7–10k/day**
* Gym: **3–4 days/week**

---

## 5️⃣ What will change first (realistic)

* Week 1–2: posture feels better, less bloating
* Week 3–4: waist tighter, belly less round
* Month 2: visible fat loss if food is aligned

---

Next time, we can:

* design **Week 2–4 progression**
* add **home posture drills**
* or sync gym + diet simply (no extreme diet)

If you want, tell me:

* how many days per week you can train (3 or 4?)
* whether you sit a lot for work
* any back or knee pain

We’ll tune it perfectly.
