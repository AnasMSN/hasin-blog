Like always, I not updating my notes for the weekend. I actually have different things happen on weekend. In Saturday, I went to Jamwon to try and experience sleding in Korea. But, first of all I start my day with chatting with my teacher in religion. This will be the last time I contact him since I will not in his group anymore. I actually very surprised to know it since it very sudden. But, life must go on and its not like I can't contact him anymore. Thank you very much teacher for your teaching.

On Saturday, I go with my friend to Jamwon to try sleding experience. Its very nice since I feel my childhood again on trying slide. It cost around 6k won per person and I try to make each slide cost 1k won so I slide 6 times. It feel awesome and I think it worth it for it price since you can go up and down anytime you want. After that me and my friend go to Itaewon to pray and then we eat on Yell-0 chicken. 

On Sunday, its very different since I didn't go anywhere except no brand. That day I didn't even compplete my walking challenge since I only walk like around 2k steps that should be 6.5K steps. I will increase my steps target since I think if I walk back in afternoon it will automatically be 8K steps per day. So, I will just change the steps target to 7K steps per day since this week.

Today, I start my day in Gym and I think it makes my mood better. I think I also to always keep my house clean since if its dirty, It makes me very lazy and can even ruin my whole day. I will start to become better everyday and hope this day can be worth the works.
