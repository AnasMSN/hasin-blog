Weekend is tomorrow. I will make sure all the goals of  this week is  finished in this week. This include the weekend. I also have agree terms with Peto about the contract in making android front end. This is about the dance apps. I hope I can finish it even though I almost don't have the experience in it. 

So my calendar crosslist already full so I cannot have another cross anymore. I think I only to restrain myself until tomorrow night. Hopefully I can successfully done this and treat myself with a galaxy watch. I will start reduce my expense starting now to buy the galaxy watch for my training and gym. Becoming better every single day always my goals and I think I have try that since the start of this blog post. Hopefully this continue  always.
