I just past the weekend and  I feel like I failed. The goals I want to finish in weekend (very easy goal btw) is failed and the reward I promised myself cannot be granted. I promise  that the reward for me successfully finished the goals is that I'm allowed to buy myself a galaxy watch or  galaxy fit. The punishment of course I cannot buy it  until  I finish  my requirements.
