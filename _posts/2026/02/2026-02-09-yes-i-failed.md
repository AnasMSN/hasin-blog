I just past the weekend and  I feel like I failed. The goals I want to finish in weekend (very easy goal btw) is failed and the reward I promised myself cannot be granted. I promise  that the reward for me successfully finished the goals is that I'm allowed to buy myself a galaxy watch or  galaxy fit. The punishment of course I cannot buy it  until  I finish  my requirements. 

Then this is my new workout routine:

Nice — finishing week 1 is already a win 💪
Based on **everything so far** (your goal: posture + belly fat, beginner phase, treadmill habit, chicken-based diet, no injuries), here is a **Week 2 plan** that is:

* **4 days only (Tue–Fri)**
* still beginner-safe
* slightly more structured than Week 1
* focused on posture + fat loss
* flexible for **single session OR split AM/PM**

No big jumps yet — this is **controlled progression**.

## 🔁 Weekly progression rules (very important)

* If last week’s weight felt easy → add **+2 kg**
* If still shaky → keep same weight
* No exercise should feel painful or sloppy

---

## 🧠 Extra posture habit (daily, 3–5 min)

Do this **at home**:

* Chest stretch
* Upper-back stretch
* Stand tall, squeeze glutes for 10 seconds × 3

This alone improves belly appearance.

---

## What you should feel by end of Week 2

* Less stiffness
* Better standing posture
* Belly feels tighter (even if scale doesn’t move much)
* Better treadmill stamina

---

Next steps (your choice):

* Week 3–4 plan
* Add home posture routine
* Simple food timing around workouts
* Or adjust if soreness was high

Tell me:

* which day felt hardest
* whether legs or back were sore

We’ll tune Week 3 properly 🔧
