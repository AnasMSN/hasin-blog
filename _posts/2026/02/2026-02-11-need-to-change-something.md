I feel the need to change something since I just become worse in self manage myself at night. I will start doing night gym today. Just small exercise to feeling myself. Let see is this will change my behavior. Also I need to change my gym routing like for the half  calf and the captain chair since the gym didn't have that equipment to do. I also need to remove the hip thrust since it feel embarassing to do it. I need to replace it with something similar.

Today though, I learn about how to cool down on your lower body. This is a good learning thing since I only know the upper body cool down.
