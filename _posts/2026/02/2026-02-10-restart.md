Yesterday I basically didn't do anything. After bad weekend of doing nothing, I continue with not doing anythin again and just waste my time to watch Youtube. I will try to make my time more productive with sound in my hear so I can become more focus.

Yesterday I feel very lazy because Liverpool make my emotion down and make myself feel lazy. I didn't even send my CV to Brian for the contract. The only thing that I finsish yesterday is buying some food for eat in this week. I take 2 days of my expense for  eat until the rest of the weekend. Hopefully it will refresh my weekly expense. I almost forgot that there will be meeting this at night  time and I also need to communicate about the Imuska coming to Kyung Hee and the gift for the graduate from Indonesia.
